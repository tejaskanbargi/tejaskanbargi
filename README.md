Projects:

**Project : Geo Enterprise SDK**

**Client - Google**

**Description:**
The Navigation SDK for Android and iOS enables rideshare providers to enhance and customize their driver experience by seamlessly embedding Google Maps turn-by-turn navigation within their mobile applications. By leveraging real-time navigation with voice guidance, the SDK helps users easily book rides or deliveries and stay updated with live trip progress. It also streamlines driver allocation and supports drivers in finding fast, reliable routes, ensuring both operational efficiency and a superior customer experience.

**Roles & Responsibilities: -**

* Ensure mobile and web applications meet client quality standards by designing and executing both manual and automated test cases in Java, structured with TestNG, and implemented using tools like Selenium WebDriver (web) and Appium (mobile), based on user stories and requirements.
* Identify, document, and prioritize defects; collaborate closely with developers to resolve bugs, perform root cause analysis, and retest fixes using TestNG test cases for verification and reporting.
* Develop comprehensive test plans, cases, and scripts using Java/TestNG; conduct functional, regression, sanity, smoke, usability, compatibility, and performance testing across different devices (phones/tablets) and operating systems (Android, iOS, Mac, Linux).
* Lead regression and exploratory testing efforts, specializing in automation with Selenium WebDriver + Java for web projects and Appium + Java for cross-platform mobile application testing.
* Perform API testing using Postman, manage emulators with Android Studio, and validate compatibility on diverse screen sizes, resolutions, and OS versions, by integrating Appium tests within TestNG frameworks.
* Execute and coordinate User Acceptance Testing (UAT) activities, manage acceptance criteria, document issues, communicate with business users and product teams, and contribute to build sign-off and QA process improvements.
* Lead QA activities by assigning TestNG test suites to team members, triaging and tracking bugs, and ensuring timely releases with minimal impact to existing product functionality by maintaining stable Selenium/Appium frameworks.
* Collaborate with automation engineers and product managers to design and maintain robust, reusable, and maintainable Java-based TestNG automation frameworks for both Selenium (web) and Appium (mobile) as part of the overall SDLC.
